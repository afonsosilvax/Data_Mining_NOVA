Consumers today are becoming more selective about the businesses they support and where they spend their money. This makes it essential for companies to develop a deep understanding of their customer base in order to tailor their services and marketing strategies more effectively.
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into smaller groups that share similar characteristics or behaviours. In the case of a food delivery company for instance, some groups may prioritise convenience and quick delivery, while others might focus on price or healthy options. Recognizing these differences will allow the company to better customise their products, services, and marketing efforts to meet the specific preferences and needs of each segment, enhancing customer satisfaction and ultimately boosting retention and revenue.

## Possible approaches
### 1. Value-based Segmentation
This segmentation focuses on dividing customers based on their economic contribution to the business. Metrics to consider include:

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate the projected revenue from a customer over time by analyzing their purchase frequency and average order value.
- Average Order Value (AOV): Identifying high vs. low spenders helps classify customers into segments like high-value, mid-tier, and low-value customers.
- Purchase Frequency: Regularity of orders can further enrich the understanding of customer value.

###  2. Behavior-based Segmentation
This involves understanding customer purchasing patterns and preferences, such as:

- Order Preferences: The type of meals they order (type of cuisine).
- Time and Day Preferences: Identify when customers typically place orders (e.g., weekdays, weekends, dinner, lunch).
